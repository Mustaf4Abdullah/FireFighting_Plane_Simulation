Forest Firefighting Simulation Project
This project simulates the movements of a firefighting aircraft extinguishing fires in different regions of a forest using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The shortest path to extinguish fires is dynamically calculated using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Key Features
Dynamic Route Planning: Calculates the optimal sequence for extinguishing fires based on fire intensity and distance.
Aircraft Management: Simulates the aircraft's fuel and water consumption, including refueling and refilling operations.
Simulation Details: Tracks total fuel and water usage, distance traveled, and the number of refueling stops.
Input/Output: Processes forest data from Orman.txt and outputs results to sonuc.txt.
